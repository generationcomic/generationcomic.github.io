        <p>After a four year hiatus, the Australian comic anthology <em>Generation</em> is returning. This project is still in its early stages, but in the coming months we will be inviting artists and opening up submissions for short comic stories, with the goal to publish a collected volume in early 2014.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p><em>Generation</em> was founded in 2004 by Sydney illustrator Katie Huang and other local artists who wanted to produce their own professional level publication. The success of the first issue grew into a yearly offering of short stories from Australia’s burgeoning manga and comics community. Although <em>Generation</em> ceased its original publication in 2009, it hasn’t been forgotten as an inspiration and showcase for Australian talent.</p>
        <p>There is an amazing community of artists here in Australia, and with the rise of social media and crowdfunding, the way we connect and share stories, art and information has changed a lot in the last four years. It’s important that we don’t lose those things that help inspire and grow our communities.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="submit">
        <h1>Submit</h1>
        <p><em>Generation</em> accepts professional level short story submissions of up to 16 pages. Black and white comics preferred, but colour submissions can be negotiated. Stand alone illustrations are also accepted (with a preference for illustrations of scenes or narratives)</p>
        <p>For more information please see our <a href="#TODO">submission guidelines</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="support">
        <h1>Support</h1>
        <p>One of the best ways you can support us right now is to spread the word about <em>Generation</em>! Follow us on social media and let your comic fans and artist friends know what we’re all about.</p>
        <p>When the book is ready we will most likely be running a campaign on <a href="http://pozile.com.au">Pozible</a> to help fund the printing costs as well (Why Pozible and not Kickstarter? Well, only the cool kids in America and England get to use Kickstarter, that’s why).</p>
